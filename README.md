# Hi, I'm Jeremy 👋

Aspiring data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into clear insights. I'm building my portfolio one project at a time as I deepen my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, and statistics.

🔎 **Currently learning & working with:**
- SQL for data cleaning and transformation  
- Python for analysis and automation  
- Tableau for dashboards and storytelling  
- Excel for fast analysis and modeling  
- Statistics for making data-driven decisions

📂 **Portfolio Projects:**
- [Layoffs Data Cleaning (SQL)](https://github.com/jkselig/layoffs-data-cleaning)  
  Cleaned and standardized a real-world layoffs dataset using MySQL. Removed duplicates, formatted values, handled NULLs, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

🛠️ More coming soon! (Python, Tableau, and EDA projects in progress)
